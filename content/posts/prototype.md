The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that involves duplicating or "cloning" existing objects to create new ones, rather than creating new objects from scratch. This is useful when object creation is time-consuming or complex. This means, instead of creating a new object and setting it up, we make a copy of an existing object and modify it as needed.
